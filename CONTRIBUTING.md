HardShell is the environment + operations layer for EXOCHAIN.

## Principles
- Keep host assumptions minimal.
- Prefer deterministic, scriptable workflows.
- Evidence-by-default: changes should be traceable.

## Local checks
- Bash scripts should pass:
  - `bash -n <script>`
  - executable bit set when intended
